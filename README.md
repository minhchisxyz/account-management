# Account Management

This application provides real-time currency exchange rates between EUR and VND, and allows users to add, view, edit, and remove transactions.

## Project Structure

The application has evolved into the following structure:

1. **spring-angular**: Contains a Spring Boot backend and an Angular frontend.
2. **next**: The main Next.js fullstack application. It provides both the web interface and the API for the mobile application.
3. **flutter_mobile**: A Flutter mobile application that consumes the API from `next-backend`.
